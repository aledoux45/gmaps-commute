## Intro
Have you ever wondered when is the best time for you to go to work / leave work in order to avoid traffic?  
This script gathers the data for you so that you can find that out!  
Essentially the `commute.py` script asks the GoogleMaps API how long it will take you to go to work now. Then you simply have to add this script to a scheduler and write the output to a csv file to gather some data!


## Script
Add a script to your folder such as `to_work.sh` and write the command to call `commute.py`.
My `to_work.sh` looks like this:
```
cd path/to/folder/ && path/to/conda/env/python commute.py --pointA="Home address" --pointB="Work address" --APIkey="Your-API-KEY" 2> logs.err
```

## API Key
To get a Google API Key:
1. Go to your (Google Console)[https://console.cloud.google.com/]
2. Create a project
3. Go to the Google Maps Platform tab (navigation bar on the left)
4. Click on APIs and enable "Directions API"
5. Click on Credentials, then on "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" at the top of the page
6. Et voil√†! You have created your Google API key. You can copy paste the API key and use it for the command.


## Crontab
On Mac or Linux:
1. Type `crontab -l` in your terminal to get the list of cronjobs currently on your machine.
2. Type `crontab -e` in your terminal to edit these cronjobs.
3. Press `i` for insert (you are in `vi`).
4. Add your cronjob, for example mine is `*/5 6-9 * * 1-5 ~/Documents/Projects/gmaps/to_work.sh`.
So that it runs every 5 minutes between 6am and 9am on weekdays.
5. Add execution permission to your bash script `chmod +x ./to_work.sh`.

Troubleshoot: 
- Check the `logs.err` file for any error message you may get.
- If you are using Mac OS Catalina or older, you may need to give permissions to `cron` (you will get the error `Operation not permitted` otherwise). This (link)[https://blog.bejarano.io/fixing-cron-jobs-in-mojave/] explains how to do it.
